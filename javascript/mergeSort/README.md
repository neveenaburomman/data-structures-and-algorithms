# Challenge Summary

Merge Sort => is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then it merges the two sorted halves.
in this challenge we will Convert the pseudo-code for mergeSort into working code  and  trace the algorithm by stepping through the process .


## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

        time complexity O(nlog(n) => because merge sort will divide the array into two subarray and takes linear time to merge two halves. 
        space complexity O(n) => because it requires an additional memory space of 0(n) for the temporary array
