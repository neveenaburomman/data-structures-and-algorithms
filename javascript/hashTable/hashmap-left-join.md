# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
- Arguments: two hash maps
   - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
   - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the   output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic.

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time complexity is o(n), because we will loop through the hashmap
- space complexity is o(n) ,because it depends on the size of the array 

## Solution

```ruby
npm test hashTable

```
