# Hashtables
Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
set , get, contains, keys, hash.

## Approach & Efficiency
### set 
Time and space complexity
### get
Time and space complexity
### contains
Time and space complexity
### keys
Time and space complexity
### hash
Time and space complexity
## API
### set 
this method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
### get
this method returns: Value associated with that key in the table
### contains
this method returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
### keys
this method returns: Collection of keys
### hash
this method returns: Index in the collection for that key
