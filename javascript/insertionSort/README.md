# Challenge Summary

insertion Sort => is a simple sorting algorithm involves the sorted list created based on an iterative comparison of each element in the list with its adjacent element that works by virtually split the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. 
in this challenge we will Convert the pseudo-code for insertionSort function  into working code  and  trace the algorithm by stepping through the process .

## Approach & Efficiency

  time complexity O(n^2) => because It has two loops, which means that as the number of elements n in the array arr grows it will take approximately O(n^2) to perform the sorting 
  space complexity O(1) => because there's no need for an  additional memory .
