# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

- Create a **Node** class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

- Create a **Binary Tree class** and define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
1- pre order
2- in order
3- post order
which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

- Create a **Binary Search Tree** class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add => Arguments: value , Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains => Argument: value , Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

BinaryTree =>>

- preOrder: space complexity O(n)
          time complexity O(n)
- inOrder: space complexity O(n)
          time complexity O(n)
- postOrder:space complexity O(n)
          time complexity O(n)

BinarySearchTree=>>

- add:      space complexity O(1)
          time complexity O(n)
- contains: space complexity O(1)
          time complexity O(n)
