# Challenge Summary

Write a function called fizz buzz tree that take an Arguments: k-ary tree and return: new k-ary tree 

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
 - Time complexity => O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the  tree 
 - Space complexity => O(h) where h is height of tree
