# tree-max

# Challenge Summary

Write a method for the Binary Tree class that find maximum value (Find the maximum value stored in the tree)
- Arguments: none
- Returns: number

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency

- Time Complexity: O(n) because it will depends on the number of nodes in the binary tree 
- Space Complexity: O(n) because it will depends on the number of nodes in the binary tree
