# tree-breadth-first

# Challenge Summary

Write a function called breadth first
- Arguments: tree
- Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Whiteboard Process



## Approach & Efficiency

- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree 
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree
