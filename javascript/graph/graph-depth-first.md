# Depth First Traversal
is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Challenge
Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first
- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
- Program output: Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
- Space Complexity:O(1) because we didn't use any extra space 
## Solution
```
npm test graph
```
