# Challenge Summary
implement a Queue using two Stacks.


## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency

**enqueue**
-Push the value to stack1 , time complexity will be O(1)
**dequeue**
push everything from stack1 to stack2,  Pop the element from stack2 and return it.here time complexity will be O(n)
