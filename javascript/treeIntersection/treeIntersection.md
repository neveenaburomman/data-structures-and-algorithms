# Challenge Summary

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters, using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time complexity is o(n^2) we will loop through two binary tree.
- space complexity is o(n)because it will depneds on the size of the array.

## Solution
```ruby
npm test treeIntersection

```
